# CYBERSEC Chapter 2: Encryption #

## Symmetric Encryption ##
__Symmetric:__
- uses 1 key given to 2 people 
- the easy/universal technique for confidential stored data
    - also referred to as conventional/single-key encryption
- Requirements 
    1. Need a strong encryption algorithm 
    2. Sender/Receiver must have the same secure key

### Attacking Symmetric Encryption ###
__Cryptanalytic Attacks__
- Exploits algo to deduce some-sort of plain-key 
    - If successful, everything encrypted with that key is compromised
- Relies on:
    - Nature of the Algorithm Used 
    - Some knowledge of plaintext characteristics 
    - Some samples of text-cipher pairs 

__Brute-Force Attacks__
- Try all possible keys until something intelligible is obtained
    - On average, half of all possible keys must be tried to achieve this

### Data Encryption Services (DES) ###
__DES:__
- used to be the most widely used encryption scheme
    - FIPS PUB 46 
        - Referred to as the Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA) 
    - method:
        - 64bit plaintext block + 56 bit key 
        - = 64bit ciphertext block 
- Concerns: 
    - Algorithm Knowledge (studied heavily)
    - 56bit key size
        - commercial processors makes this key inadequate

__Triple DES (3DES):__
- repeating DES using two or three unique keys 
- Pros:
    - 168bit key length overcomes most/all brute-force concerns
    - Underlying encryption algorithm is the same as in DES
- Cons:
    - Algorithm is Sluggish
    - Uses a 64bit block size

__Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):__
- Feasible replacement for 3DES
- FIPS 197
- Properties:
    - More security strength than 3DES
    - More efficient than DES 
    - Symmetric block cipher still
    - 128bit data and 128/192/256-bit keys

__DES Security Issues:__
- Usually data-blocks need to be more than 64/128-bit blocks
- Electronic Codeblock (ECB):
    - each block of plaintext is encrypted w/ the same key 
        - regularities may be exploitable 
- Modes of Operation:
    - Alt. techniques developed that:
        - increase symmetric large-block security
        - overcome ECB weaknesses

### Block and Stream Ciphers ###
__Block Cipher:__
- processes input one block at a time 
- outputs one block for each block 
- can reuse keys 
- common

__Stream Cipher:__
- processes input elements continuously (1 at a time)
- usually faster 
- encrypts one byte at a time 
- pseudorandom stream that is nearly unpredictable

### Message Authentification ###
- verify that a message is authentic: 
    - contents are not altered
    - sent from the correct source at the right time 
- can use conventional encryption (symmetrical)
- can be done separately from encryption
    - often involve hash functions to assert validity

__Hash Function Properties:__
- SHA is most common 
- For message authentification:
    - can be applied to a block of any size
    - produces a fixed-length output
    - H(x) is relatively easy to computer for any given x
    - One-way (Non-Invertible)
    - Computationally Unique
    - Collision-Resistant
        - y != x, then H(y) != H(x)
- Vulnerabilities:
    - Cryptanalysis 
        - depends on hash algo. security
    - Brute-Force Attack
        - depends on hash code length
- Additional Features: 
    - Hash Passwords (locally store a hash-password)
    - Intrusion Detection (locally store hash files)


## Asymmetric Encryption ## 
- Publicly Proposed by Diffie and Hellman in 1976
- Based on Mathematical Functions 

__Asymmetric:__
- uses 2 keys given to 2 people 
- public key and private key 
    - public key is made public for others to use
    - private key lets you see text from the public key 
    - people send messages based on the receiver's public & private keys

### Public-Key Cryptosystems Requirements ###
- computationally easy to create pairs 
- computationally easy for sender knowing public keys to Encrypt
- computationally easy for reciever knowing private key to Decrypt
- computationally infeasible for opponent to discern private from public keys
- computationally infeasible for opponent to recover original message
- useful if either key can be used for each role 

### Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms ### 
__RSA:__
- developed in 1977 (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)
- most widely accepted/implemented approach to public-key encryption
- block cipher in which: 
    - plaintext & ciphertext are integers between 0 and n-1, for some n 

__Diffie-Hellman:__
- enables two users to securely reach agreement about a shared secret
- limited to the exchange of literal keys 

__Digital Signature Standard (DSS):__ 
- provides only a digital signature function w/ SHA-1 
- cannot be used for encryption or key exchange 

__Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):__
- like RSA, but with much smaller keys 

### Digital Signatures ###
- Data-Dependent bit pattern generated by an agent as some sort of data block
- NIST FIPS PUB 186-4 defined how to do this: 
    1. Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
    2. RSA Digital Signature Algorithm 
    3. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

## Random Numbers ##
__Random:__
- Uses: 
    - generating basically all kinds of keys ever
    - handshaking to prevent replay attacks 
- Requirements:
    - Uniform Distribution
    - Independence
    - Unpredictability

__Pseudorandom:__
- like Random, but more predictable
- you can't use deterministic algo.s to generate true-random numbers
- predicatble and statistically normalized, on some level

__TRNG (True RNG:)__
- uses nondeterministic source to produce randomness 
    - often involve measuring unpredictable natural processes
- increasingly provided on modern processors
